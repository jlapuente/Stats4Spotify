## Credits

The idea of the project was made on a previous project `https://spotify-stats-tracker.vercel.app/#/` that i made in order to learn the Spotify Api.
Then when i made some improvementes to my own code i decided to re-start the project to maintain a optimized and clean code.
When adding some new funcionalities i found Receiptify, a page that made receipts with the most played songs of the loged users, i remade the functionality on my own and added on my app.
I added some personalization and some new options like the possibility of making one receipt with the most listened artist of the user.
